# Vercel Blob Deployment Checklist

Since you already have Vercel Blob set up (BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN exists), you're ready to deploy!

## ✅ Pre-deployment Checklist

1. **Cancel the Blob setup dialog** - You don't need a new Blob store
2. **Verify environment variable** - Check that `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` exists in your Vercel project settings
3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Vercel Blob support for large file uploads in Knowledge Store"
   git push
   ```

## 🚀 What will happen after deployment:

1. **File uploads will automatically use Vercel Blob** for all sizes
2. **Small files** (< 4.5MB) - Upload normally
3. **Large files** (up to 500MB) - Direct browser-to-Blob upload
4. **Text extraction** happens server-side after upload completes

## 🧪 Testing after deployment:

1. Go to Knowledge Store
2. Click "Upload File"
3. Try uploading:
   - A small PDF (< 5MB)
   - A medium file (10-50MB)
   - A large file (100MB+)

All should work seamlessly!

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

- **Local development**: File uploads work, but the post-processing might not trigger locally
- **Production**: Everything works automatically
- **Storage limits**: Check your Vercel plan's Blob storage quota

## 🎉 You're all set!

Your existing Vercel Blob storage will handle all Knowledge Store uploads automatically.
